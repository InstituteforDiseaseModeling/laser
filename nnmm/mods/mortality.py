# ## Non-Disease Mortality 
# ### Part II
# 
# We import `pdsod` ("predicted_days_of_death") which currently uses a USA 2003 survival table. `pdsod` will draw for a year of death (in or after the current age year) and then will draw a day in the selected year.
# 
# **Note:** the incoming values in `model.population.dob` are positive (_ages_). After we use them to draw for date of death, we negate them to convert them to dates of birth (in days) prior to now (t=0).

def init( model ):

    dods[0:population.count] = pdsod(dobs[0:population.count], max_year=100)
    tfinish = datetime.now(tz=None)  # noqa: DTZ005
    print(f"Elapsed time for drawing dates of death: {tfinish - tstart}")

    dods -= dobs.astype(dods.dtype) # renormalize to be relative to _now_ (t = 0)
    dobs *= -1  # convert ages to date of birth prior to _now_ (t = 0) âˆ´ negative
    print(f"First 32 DoBs (should all be negative - these agents were born before today):\n{dobs[:32]}")
    print(f"First 32 DoDs (should all be positive - these agents will all pass in the future):\n{dods[:32]}")

        # Get list of indices we would EULA-ify

        dod_filtered = model.population.dod[0:split_index]
        # Convert these all to "simulation year of death"

        # Now 'squash' (split) the population to keep only the non-EULA group
        model.population.eliminate_eulas( split_index=split_index )


# ## Non-Disease Mortality 
# ### Part III
# 
# If we had no births, we could use a regular FIFO queue with the dates of death sorted to process non-disease deaths in time order. However, we may have agents born during the simulation who are predicted to die from non-disease causes before the end of the simulation and need to be insert, in sorted order, into the queue. So, we will use a priority queue - a data structure which allows for efficient insertion and removal while maintaining sorted order - to keep track of agents by date of non-disease death.

# During the simulation, we will process all agents with a predicated date of death today marking them as deceased and removing them from the active population count.

# **_TODO:_** Set a state to indicate "deceased" _or_ ignore the priority queue altogether and compare `dod` against `tick` and ignore agents where `dod < tick`.
