# We will add a `network` property to the model to hold the connection weights between the nodes.
# 
# We initialize $n_{ij} = n_{ji} = k \frac {P_i^a \cdot P_j^b} {D_{ij}^c}$
# 
# Then we limit outgoing migration from any one node to `max_frac`.

# ## Transmission Part II - Tick/Step Processing Phase
# 
# On a tick we accumulate the contagion in each node - currently 1 unit per infectious agent - with `np.add.at()` ([documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ufunc.at.html)).
# 
# We calculate the incoming and outgoing contagion by multiplying by the network connection values.
# 
# We determine the force of infection per agent in each node by multiplying by the seasonally adjusted $\beta$ and normalizing by the node population. $\beta_{eff}$ is currently a scalar but it would be trivial to add a `beta` property to `model.nodes` and have per node betas.
# 
# We then visit each susceptible agent and draw against the force of infection to determine transmission and draw for duration of infection if transmission occurs.
# 
# We will also track incidence by node and tick.
