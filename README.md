## Temporary README for `well-mixed-abc` Branch

- use `python3 -m pip install -e .` in the root to install the code<br>at the moment there is only a very little shared code in the poorly named `homogenous_abc.py` file
- in the `tests` directory there are three sample models:
  - `test_agentsir.py`
  - `test_agentseir.py`
  - `test_spatialseir.py`

### `test_agentsir.py`

Simulates a single well-mixed community with **_SIR_** infection dynamics.

Use the `--help` option to see the command line parameters. The code will write a .CSV, `sir.csv`, to the script directory (`tests`).

### `test_agentseir.py`

Simulates a single well-mixed community with **_SEIR_** infection dynamics.

Use the `--help` option to see the command line parameters. The code will write a .CSV, `seir.csv`, to the script directory (`tests`).

### `test_spatialseir.py`

Simulates a number of _connected communities_, each well-mixed and with **_SEIR_** infection dynamics.

This model currently loads LGA, population, and connectivity data for 774 admin level 2 LGAs in Nigeria along with population data from 2015. The connectivity weights are from a gravity model.

`load_population()` and `load_network()` are in their own functions now to make it easier to customize for another scenario (e.g., England/Wales).

Use the `--help` option to see the command line parameters. The code will write two .CSV files, `spatial_seir.csv` and `spatial_seir_report.csv`, to the working directory. The former has aggregated S, E, I, and R populations at each timestep. The latter has a column for each community, at each timestep, with the number of infected agents in that community at that timestep.

## Problem Space

The problem is inherently an issue of heterogeneity. Spatial decomposition is the easiest consideration, but not sufficient - a model of N "independent" but identical communities is generally not useful.

Spatial connectivity and the associated latencies in transmission address one dimension of heterogeneity: how "close" is a given community to a potential source of imported contagion (exogenous to the model "world", locally endogenous, e.g., an adjacent community, endogenous but at a remove - rare transmission or multi-stop chain of transmission).

Community size in a spatial model is also a consideration - what is the configuration and connectivity of sub-CCS nodes to nodes at or above CCS for the given disease?

We need configurable characteristics of the individual communities which can vary, along with their interconnectedness, to capture additional heterogeneity.

What _is_ the modeling of the individual communities? "Light-Agent" seems to limit us to an ABM, but we should consider cohorts of epidemiologically similar populations (polio >5, HIV <15, TB latents, etc.) as well as stochastic compartmental models.

Are the individual communities well-mixed or should we also provide for explicit networks at the local level?

## Technology

- Python
- NumPy / NUMBA / Â¿PyCUDA?
- native code
  - C++ (somewhat awkward interop with Python, but potentially accessible from other technologies, e.g., R)
  - Rust ([PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) is quite nice, but requires getting up to speed on Rust ðŸ˜³)
- compute requirements:
  - laptop 2010+? (might inform SIMD capabilities)
  - GPU (CUDA) enabled machine laptop/desktop/cloud
  - single core/multi-core
  - largest scenarios?
- visualization
  - cross-platform
  - real-time
- existing file formats for input data
- existing file formats for output data (GeoTIFF? - works with ArcGIS?)

## Other

- community builder tool for given total population and community size distribution
- network builder given a set of communities (gravity, radiation, other algorithms in existing libraries/packages)
- independent populations w/in a community, e.g., mosquitoes or dogs along with humans
- independent or co-transmission, i.e. multiple "diseases"
- models need to be connected with real-world scenarios, not [just] hypothetical explorations

## Notes

- "light" : How light is "light"?
- "agent" : Cohorts? Stochastic compartmental?
- "spatial" : How good are the individual community models? Good enough for non-spatial questions?
- dynamic properties (e.g. GPU flu simulation)
- Â¿Ace/clorton-based state machines?
