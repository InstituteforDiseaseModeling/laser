# Development and Contributing to Code

Here's where all the relevant info for submitting tickets for bugs or feature requests, how to contribute to code, etc should go. No need to include persona information, users will navigate the docs based on what tasks they want to do. [If needed, this topic can be broken up with subtopic pages]

## Bugs and improvements

all info for filing tickets, requesting doc improvements, or new features can go here (it should all basically be "how to file a ticket with us on GH")

## Contributing to code

Introduction to the topic: will include the basic how-tos of working with the IDM team as well as how to actually work on LASER code

### GitHub best practices

how to engage with IDM on GH, what's required for PRs etc (not bug tickets but how to fork & submit PRs)

### Development best practices

other help that's not related to unit tests or code optimization, relevant info from the "iterative development cycle" can go here (only if it's actual workflow steps; don't include if that's just a generalized workflow)

### Running tests/unit tests

all relevant sections on unit tests and code testing

### Optimizing code

I'd include the help with Numba, Numpy here, and the info on C and OpenMP.
