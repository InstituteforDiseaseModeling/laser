# Software Overview

introduction to how LASER pieces fit together, such as core, generic, etc. Also talk about how core is comprised of various components, and mention that the architecture will be discussed in detail on the architecture page.

Can include relevant software principles, or design choices. Included topics should be things that are unique to laser, such that modelers would need to know what this is in order to utilize laser properly (i.e. don't include general modeling principles, assume that the user already knows those)
