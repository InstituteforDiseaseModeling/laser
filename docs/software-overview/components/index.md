# Software Components


Components are modular units of functionality within the simulation, responsible for performing specific updates or computations on the agent population or node-level data. Each component is implemented as a class with an initialization function to set up any required state and a step function to execute the componentâ€™s logic during each timestep.

[Deep dive into components and how they work, how they comprise laser functionality. Each "type" of component will have a topic section as needed]

Make it clear that this is not a comprehensive list, but a call-out for the various functions the user can play with (link to API docs for full listing of laser functions)
