# Simulation Data and Properties

<!-- I think it's worth calling out LaserFrame and PropertySet as features, since this is where the nuts and bolts seem to happen (page could use a better title)

LaserFrame: basically a database that manages the dynamically allocated data for agents and nodes

PropertySet: stores the agent properties in a dictionary-like object (such as infection status, region, exposure timers, etc) -->
