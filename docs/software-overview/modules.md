# Modules (or Models?)

Looks like there are "model classes" that manage components?? (Looking at the Vital Dynamics Model page)

Rename "Classes" depending on what the architecture actually is.

May need a drop-down section like components if we have multiple types; right now it looks like Vital Dynamics would go here
