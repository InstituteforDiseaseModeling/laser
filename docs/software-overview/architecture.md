# Software Architecture

This is where the design elements of laser need to be clearly described, so the user can map all of the terminology.

For example:

- components
    - list component types (if there are categories or other specifics)
- laser scripts?
- objects?
- libraries?
- modules?
- models?
- other "things" that are used by laser?

This is not intended to be a full "parameter list" or set of API docs, this is a framework of how laser is put together
