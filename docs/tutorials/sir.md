# Building an SIR Model


So there are multiple SIR model examples currently in the doc; I think it would make sense to have a single SIR tutorial, where you add complexity to the framework (unless there's something very different?). Basically, start with simple SIR, add spatial dynamics, add real data, add other functions, etc (start in the most basic way and then build up each new feature). It seems easier to keep the topic as one instead of multiple SIR topics floating around.

Make sure the instructions/introduction clearly states that this is using laser-core (in case there are other sir models using generic, etc)

## Simple SIR

## Spatial SIR

### Using synthetic data

### Using real data
