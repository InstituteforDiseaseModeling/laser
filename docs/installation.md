# Installation and software requirements

LASER was developed to fulfill a variety of modeling needs. `Laser-core` can be installed standalone with:

```
pip install laser-core
```

Install `laser-core` if you are interested in using the components to develop your own, customized model. More information on modeling with `laser-core` can be found in [../get-started/custom.md].


## LASER disease models

If you are interested in exploring model dynamics with `laser-generic` or other disease-specific models, you may find installation and user instructions in [Get Started Modeling](./get-started/prebuilt.md).


## LASER development

If you are interested in contributing to code, instructions on how to install for development can be found in [Development](../development/index.md).
