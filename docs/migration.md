Migration
=========

Some things to note:

These models all take in some parameters, along with a vector of
populations and distances between nodes, and spit out a matrix defining
the connection between nodes.

-   When comparing to other models, it\'s important to consider how
    implementation of the migration / connection model affects
    interpretation of the parameters. For example, a migration matrix
    could be implemented as a per-capita rate of travel from $i$ to $j$,
    or as a total flux of people from $i$ to $j$. If your migration
    model has a term that scales like $p_i^a$, using a per-capita rate
    introduces an implicit $+1$ into the exponent. Or, depending on how
    infectivity / mixing is handled locally, if the introduced
    infectivity is normalized to local population, that might introduce
    an ambiguity in interpreting the exponent on the destination
    population, is it $b$ or $b-1$, effectively? In the end, these are
    terms that could be calibrated away, but useful to keep this in mind
    for interpretation and comparison against other models - we aim to
    support users defining their own migration models and
    implementations, and this sort of ambiguity is important to keep in
    mind.
-   I\'m aiming to do most of this with element-by-element numpy
    functions when I can, though loops would probably translate more
    obviously to numba/c. I don\'t expect that computation of these
    matrices will be a substantial part of overall computational spend
    on a model either way.
-   I have not tested nor written code to enforce conditions on the
    inputs. This should be done - e.g., populations coming in as
    integers can present wrapping issues when we start exponentiating
    and multiplying them (signed integers in particular can be a problem
    because you may wrap into negative numbers). So some input checking
    and such needs to be done.
-   It\'s also worth investigating whether using large floats makes
    sense when computing these formulas, or whether we should put
    operations in a specific order. This is because depending on the
    choice of someone\'s metapop network and spatial model parameters,
    and the order of computations, we can end up multiplying, dividing,
    summing over numbers that can be across really different scales, so
    weirdness might happen with loss of precision? The integer issue
    above is more concerning and one that I have run into in the past.
-   Distances on the diagonal of the distance matrix should always be 0.
    We should check for 0s elsewhere and throw an error. It\'s also nice
    to be able to use numpy element-by-element math without constant
    div-by-zero errors for the diagonal elements, so maybe each function
    should start by adding epsilon to the diagonal of the distance
    matrix? We\'re going to zero out those terms in the network
    anyway\...

Gravity model
-------------

Functional form: $M_{i,j} = k \frac{p_i^a p_j^b}{d_{i,j}^c}$

Special cases of the gravity model (as noted above, both population
exponents are subject to $\pm1$ ambiguity depending on implementation of
spatial connectivity and local mixing):

-   Xia\'s model: $a = 0$
-   mean-field model: $c = 0, a = 1, b = 1$
-   spatial diffusion: $a = 0, b = 0$

### Example usage

Below is an example of how to use the gravity model to compute migration
flows between populations located at specific distances. The example
assumes unequal population sizes and calculates the number of migrants
moving between nodes based on the gravity model.

``` {.sourceCode .python}
import numpy as np
from laser_core.migration import gravity

# Define populations and distances
populations = np.array([5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000])  # Unequal populations
distances = np.array([
    [0.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0],
    [10.0, 0.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0],
    [15.0, 10.0, 0.0, 10.0, 15.0],
    [20.0, 15.0, 10.0, 0.0, 10.0],
    [25.0, 20.0, 15.0, 10.0, 0.0]
])

# Gravity model parameters
k = 0.1    # Scaling constant
a = 0.5    # Exponent for the population of the origin
b = 1.0    # Exponent for the population of the destination
c = 2.0    # Exponent for the distance

# Compute the gravity model network
migration_network = gravity(populations, distances, k=k, a=a, b=b, c=c)

# Normalize to ensure total migrations represent 1% of the population
total_population = np.sum(populations)
migration_fraction = 0.01  # 1% of the population migrates
scaling_factor = (total_population * migration_fraction) / np.sum(migration_network)
migration_network *= scaling_factor

# Generate a node ID array for agents
node_ids = np.concatenate([np.full(count, i) for i, count in enumerate(populations)])

# Initialize a 2D array for migration counts
migration_matrix = np.zeros_like(distances, dtype=int)

# Select migrants based on the gravity model
for origin in range(len(populations)):
    for destination in range(len(populations)):
        if origin != destination:
            # Number of migrants to move from origin to destination
            num_migrants = int(migration_network[origin, destination])
            # Select migrants randomly
            origin_ids = np.where(node_ids == origin)[0]
            selected_migrants = np.random.choice(origin_ids, size=num_migrants, replace=False)
            # Update the migration matrix
            migration_matrix[origin, destination] = num_migrants
```

This example demonstrates the end-to-end process of using the gravity
model to calculate migration flows and randomly assign agents to those
flows. The resulting migration matrix shows the number of individuals
migrating between nodes.

Capping the total fraction of population that can migrate / infectivity that can be exported on a given timestep
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the inputs to spatial models (populations, distances) can vary
over many orders of magnitude, we can run into situations where a a
small number of nodes, often those closest to but distinct from large
population centers, will end up with huge outflows. The below
illustrates an easy way to implement a standard gravity/radiation/etc.
model, but cap the total amount of migration/infectivity outflow from
any single metapopulation.

The Competing Destinations model
--------------------------------

There are many models that aim to account for the impact of competition
or synergy between potential destinations. Some aim to account for some
\"screening\" effect of travel to distant destinations due to
competition from attractive destinations closer to the origin $i$. This
model, in contrast, (Fotheringham AS. Spatial flows and spatial
patterns. Environment and Planning A. 1984;16(4):529--543) aims to
account for effects from other attractive destinations near destination
$j$; notably, this effect could be synergistic or antagonistic,
depending on the sign of the exponent $\delta$.

For example, in a \"synergistic\" version, perhaps migratory flow from
Boston to Baltimore is higher than flow between two comparator cities of
similar population and at similar distance, because the proximity of
Washington, D.C. to Baltimore makes travel to Baltimore more attractive
to Bostonians -- this would be accounted for by a positive value of
$\delta$. On the other hand, this term may also be \"antagonistic\", if
Washington is such an attractive destination that Bostonians eschew
travel to Baltimore entirely; this would indicate a negative value of
$\delta$.

Mathematical Formulation:
$M_{i,j} = k \frac{p_i^a p_j^b}{d_{i,j}^c} \left(\sum_{k \ne i,j} \frac{p_k^b}{d_{jk}^c}\right)^\delta$

Stouffer\'s rank model
----------------------

Stouffer (Stouffer SA. Intervening opportunities: a theory relating
mobility and distance. American Sociological Review. 1940;5(6):845--867)
argued that human mobility patterns do not respond to absolute distance
directly, but only indirectly through the accumulation of intervening
opportunities for destinations. Stouffer thus proposed a model with no
distance-dependence at all, rather only a term that accounts for all
potential destinations closer than destination $j$; thus,
longer-distance travel depends on the density of attractive destinations
at shorter distances.

Mathematical formulation:

Define $\Omega(i,j)$ to be the set of all locations $k$ such that
$D_{i,k} \le D_{i,j}$

$M_{i,j} = k p_i^a \sum_j \left(\frac{p_j}{\sum_{k \in \Omega(i,j)} p_k}\right)^b$

This presents us with the choice of whether or not the origin population
$i$ is included in $\Omega$ -- i.e., does the same \"gravity\" that
brings others to visit a community reduce the propensity of that
community\'s members to travel to other communities?

The Stouffer model does not include impact from the local community:
$\Omega(i,j) = \left(k: 0 < D_{i,k} \le D_{i,j}\right)$.

The Stouffer variant model does include the impact of the local
community: $\Omega(i,j) = \left(k: 0 \le D_{i,k} \le D_{i,j}\right)$.

Rather than implementing twice, this implementation of the Stouffer
model will include a parameter \"include\_home.\"

Radiation model
---------------

The radiation model (Simini F, González MC, Maritan A, Barabási AL. A
universal model for mobility and migration patterns. Nature.
2012;484(7392):96--100.) is a parameter-free model (up to an overall
scaling constant for total migration flux), derived from arguments
around job-related commuting but essentially capturing a situation in
which outbound migration flux from origin to destination is enhanced by
destination population and absorbed by the density of nearer
destinations.

Mathematical formulation: With $\Omega$ defined as above in the Stouffer
model,

$M_{i,j} = k \frac{p_i p_j}{\left(p_i + \sum_{k \in \Omega(i,j)} p_k\right)\left(p_i + p_j + \sum_{k \in \Omega(i,j)} p_k\right)}$

We again use the parameter \"include\_home\" to determine whether or not
location $i$ is to be included in $\Omega(i,j)$.
