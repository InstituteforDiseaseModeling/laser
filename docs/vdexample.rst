Vital Dynamics Model
===========================

Overview
========
This module implements a vital dynamics model using the LASER framework. The model simulates
population dynamics, including births and deaths, over a specified period. The key point with vital dynamics in LASER is that we don't want to add to or remove from our agent population so we preallocate inactive or preborn agents in anticipation of birthing/activating them mid-simulation, and with deaths we don't actually remove them or deallocate memory. One possible solution is a constant population scenario where every death results in a birth, so the agents are recycled in place. That has some of its own complications and is not the general case, so we are not doing that here. Key features include:

- **Births**: New agents are added to the population based on a crude birth rate (CBR).
- **Deaths**: Agents are marked as dead based on their predicted lifespan, using a Kaplan-Meier estimator.
- **Reporting**: Tracks births and deaths over time using LaserFrames.
- **Visualization**: Plots population trends over time.

Classes
=======
The following classes are implemented:

1. **VitalDynamicsModel**: The main model class that manages the population and coordinates components. You do not have to use an enclosing Model class but it's recommended. You can call it whatever you like.
2. **BirthsComponent**: Handles births in the simulation. Can be called whatever you like, but should have a constructor and a step function. Can also have reporting and/or visualization methods.
3. **DeathsComponent**: Manages deaths in the simulation. Can be called whatever you like, but should have a constructor and a step function. Can also have reporting and/or visualization methods.

Functions
=========
The following utility functions are provided:

1. **create_cumulative_deaths**: Generates a cumulative deaths array for use with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. In practice, you will probably provide cumulative deaths data from a file.

Sections
========

1. **Model Class**:
   - Describes and intializes the population and tracks its dynamics. Holds the main methods which manage population lifecycle.
2. **Births Component**:
   - Handles the addition/activation of new agents.
3. **Deaths Component**:
   - Handles agent removal/deactivation based on their lifespan.
4. **Utility Functions**:
   - Provides helper methods such as cumulative deaths generation.

Simulation Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation parameters are defined using the `PropertySet` class.

.. code-block:: python

    params = PropertySet({
        "population_size": 100_000,
        "cbr": 15, # Crude Birth Rate: 15 per 1000 per year
        "timesteps": 365*10 # Run for 10 years
    })

Running the Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model is initialized with the defined parameters, components are added, and the simulation is run for the specified timesteps. Results are then visualized.

.. code-block:: python

    # Load example population pyramid
    laser_core_path = importlib.util.find_spec("laser_core").origin
    laser_core_dir = os.path.dirname(laser_core_path)
    pyramid_file = os.path.join(laser_core_dir, "data/us-pyramid-2023.csv")
    pyramid = load_pyramid_csv(pyramid_file)

    # Build cumulative deaths array
    sampler = AliasedDistribution(pyramid[:, 2])
    cumulative_deaths = create_cumulative_deaths(params["population_size"])

    # Initialize the model
    model = VitalDynamicsModel(params, death_estimator, pyramid, sampler )

    # Initialize and add components
    model.add_component(BirthsComponent(model, params["cbr"], death_estimator))
    model.add_component(DeathsComponent(model))

    # Run the simulation
    model.run()

    # Plot results
    model.plot_results()

Conclusion
----------

The Vital Dynamics example demonstrates how to use LASER's modular components to simulate realistic population dynamics over time, including births, deaths, and age-structured demographics. By combining the ``KaplanMeierEstimator`` for mortality predictions with dynamic birth rates and agent-based properties, this example highlights the flexibility and scalability of the LASER framework for demographic modeling. Users can extend this baseline example with additional components, such as migration or disease dynamics, to create more complex simulations tailored to their specific research questions. This example serves as a foundational building block for models requiring detailed population structure and temporal dynamics.
