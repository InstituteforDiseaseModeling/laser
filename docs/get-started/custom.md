# Creating Custom Models

How to model using LASER-core components

Installation should be already done, those instructions were on the installation page (link to it)


Potential list of topics (edit based on how you actually do this! This may end up being a landing page, and each topic has its own page)

## Assembling components/building a model

make sure to include the base requirements: what components are needed to run a model? How do you create the base model?

### Manually

### Setting up Jenner (or your own AI interface)

## Loading data...

## Initializing populations

## Squashing, saving, loading ..?

## Other pre-run tasks :-)

## Running simulations

## Calibrating the model

### Calibration to debug

### Calibration to fit data

## Optimizing the model

## Tutorials and examples

Note that many of the above sections should have example code included in them; this section should be examples of an end-to-end process, or a compilation of all of the above tasks (eg how to put all the pieces together)
