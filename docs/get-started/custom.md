# Create custom models

<!-- How to model using LASER-core components

Installation should be already done, those instructions were on the installation page (link to it)


Potential list of topics (edit based on how you actually do this! This may end up being a landing page, and each topic has its own page)
-->

## Assemble components/building a model

<!-- make sure to include the base requirements: what components are needed to run a model? How do you create the base model? (define parameters, add components, run sim, visualize output?) -->

### Manually

### Set up an AI interface

The modular structure of LASER was designed to ultimately be use with AI.

For internal IDM users, you can use a pre-built AI interface, [JENNER-GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-674f5fd33aec8191bcdc1a2736fb7c8d-laser-gpt-jenner?model=gpt-4o) to create your simulations.

For external users, while we cannot currently grant you access to internal tools, we can help you create your own AI interface.

## Run simulations


## Visualize output



<!-- Note: pulled out the sections loading data, initializing populations, squashing/saving/loading, and put them on a separate topic page. BUT if they should all be done prior to running sims, then should integrate them into this page, with "running simulations" as the last step. (I don't fully understand how to actually build a model yet, so this section of the TOC is still squishy).

This page should focus on the basics of what to do, all of the "additional" tasks are subpages.




Make sure to capture all relevant steps that are currently in tutorials. Users should be able to look here for basic instructions.-->
