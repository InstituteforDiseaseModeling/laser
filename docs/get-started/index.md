# Get started modeling

<!-- This is the basis for USING laser. Any type of "quickstart" info, all the how-to, what to do, etc goes in this section. This landing page should provide a layout of the relevant topics, and let users know that there are prebuilt disease models (including generic) as well as bespoke modeling options using core. -->


## Pre-built LASER disease models

<!-- Link away to docsets for Generic, Measles, Cholera? (others as they're built)

Will want the disease-specific docsets to contain:

- installation/setup/requirements
- new features/modules (eg what's added from core)
- creating sims
- running sims
- calibration
- tutorials & examples
- parameters & api docs
-->


## Create custom models with LASER-Core
