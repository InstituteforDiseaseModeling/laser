# Optimizing Custom Models

As an agent-based model, research using LASER will require thousands of simulation replicates. While the model is designed to perform well with populations of thousands of agents, there is still a need to utilize high compute power and to optimize model performance.

When creating custom models, knowing how to identify and fix performance bottlenecks can save compute time and speed results.
