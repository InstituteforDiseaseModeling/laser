# Calibrating Custom Models

LASER can be calibrated using [Optuna](https://optuna.org/). Calibration is a process of tuning model parameters to fit real-world data, to ensure that model output provides accurate insights. Calibration can also be used as a method to help debug your model, as an inability to recreate known phenomena can help pinpoint issues in model code. For more information on calibration, check out IDM's [ModelingHub](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/modeling-hub/calibration/).
