# Laser Disease Models

Link away to docsets for Generic, Measles, Cholera? (others as they're built)

Will want the disease-specific docsets to contain:

- installation/setup/requirements
- new features/modules (eg what's added from core)
- creating sims
- running sims
- calibration
- tutorials & examples
- parameters & api docs
