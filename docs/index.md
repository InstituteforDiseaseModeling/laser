# LASER documentation

LASER (Light Agent Spatial modeling for ERadication) is a high-performance, agent-based simulation framework for modeling the spread of infectious diseases. It supports spatial structure, age demographics, and modular disease logic using Python-based components. LASER provides flexible components for creating, extending, and calibrating dynamic epidemiological models.

LASER has several pre-built models that you can use to explore disease dynamics without the need to code a model from scratch. These models include built-in examples ranging from simple compartmental models to more complex agent-based models with spatial dynamics. The modular structure of LASER also enables you to build custom models to fit particular research needs, through the integration or modification of the LASER-core components. As an open source model, the LASER team also encourages experienced users to extend the LASER framework by contributing to code!


[Don't write out personas or split tasks into persona groups; the docs should be task-oriented, so users can determine what they need by what tasks they're trying to accomplish. Understanding personas is an internal tool so we can appropriately identify tasks & necessary info]
