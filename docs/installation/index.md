# Installation and software requirements

Environment requirements

Pip install laser-generic

Pip install laser-core (?)

Other versions?

Other notes?

Info on Jenner, or other AI set-up instructions

Installation for development should go with the development & contributing to code section (could be here too with a link there, but should be in the dev section)

[For example, on the "Calibration workflow for laser models" page, the prereq's include a Python environment with optuna, pandas, and numpy installed, so there should be info on what's necessary in your enviro, if it's not all installed with the Pip install]
